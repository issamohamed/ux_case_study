# UX Case Studies

A collection of interactive design case studies exploring UI/UX across different markets and industries. Each project fuses established design systems with bold product philosophies to create distinctive, functional interfaces.

## About

These case studies represent a code-first approach to UX/UI design. Rather than static mockups, each project is a fully interactive prototype built in React—demonstrating that great design can emerge directly from code.

**What makes these different:**
- Fully functional prototypes, not wireframes
- Real interactions, animations, and hover states
- Design systems documented alongside implementation
- Built to showcase both design thinking and technical execution

## Tech Stack

- **React** — Component architecture
- **CSS-in-JS** — Scoped styling via inline style objects
- **React Router** — Client-side navigation
- **Cloudflare Pages** — Hosting & deployment
